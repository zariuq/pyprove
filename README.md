## Quick Install

   $ pip install . --user

## Developers

   $ pip install -e . --user

## MacOS

For this program to work the timout command must be available.
Since this is normally not the case install it first by running (assumes brew):

```sh
brew install coreutils
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/gtimeout /usr/local/bin/timeout
```

Check if the command works by running

```sh
timeout --help
```
